<h1>Building Home Network Project</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
I built a simple home network in Packet Tracer within the Logical Workspace in this activity.
<br />


<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>


<h3>Step 1: Added Network Devices to the Workspace</h3>

I began by adding essential network devices to the Logical Workspace. This included a PC, a laptop, and a cable modem. The cable modem was connected to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) via a coaxial cable and to the local network through an Ethernet cable. The devices were added using the Device-Type Selection Box:
- **PC:** End Devices > End Devices > PC
- **Laptop:** End Devices > End Devices > Laptop
- **Cable Modem:** Network Devices > WAN Emulation > Cable Modem

<h3>Step 2: Changed Display Names of the Network Devices</h3>

Next, I changed the display names of the network devices for clarity:
- Clicked on each device icon in the Logical Workspace.
- Selected the Config tab in the device configuration window.
- Updated the Display Name field to "Shahin PC," "Laptop," and "Cable Modem."
